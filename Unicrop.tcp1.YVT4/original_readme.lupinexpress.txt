Data Overview:
As part of the narrow-leafed lupin genome sequencing project we have developed several genetic and genomic resources. These include 1) transcriptome datasets for five different tissue types (leaf, stem, root, flower and seed) for the cultivars Tanjil and Unicrop and the wild accession P27255; 2) a survey genome assembly for the narrow-leafed lupin cultivar Tanjil and 3) extensive gene-based molecular markers which have been validated on the P27255 (wild) x  83A:476 (domestic) recombinant inbred line (RIL) population.
